I am interested in the Administrative Addisstant position at the Consulate General of Switzerland.  
The Conslulate mission to bring Swiss and American cultures together is joyfull and fullfilling 
endeavor.  I had a real pleasure meeting team members during events organized by my previous 
company.

I grew up in Zurich, where I studied business  and later lived in Geneva and Brussels where speaking with French natives
greatly improved my French. New York City has been my home for the last three years.  


My knowlege of both culturies 
I would love to be part of the Consulte team to continue its mission in promoting friendship, business and cultural 
exchange between our two countries.
 

I appreciate your taking the time to review my credentials and experience. Again, thank you for your consideration.
